## __Description__
This app is for tracking progress for workouts. The user can log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day, and should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, the user is able to track distance traveled.

### __Installation__
Installation:  You will need to have Node installed and then run ```npm install``` to be able to run.  To run the program locally, you can either install [Nodemon](https://nodemon.io/) or just run ```node server.js```.  After this step, open your browser and navigate to ```localhost:3000```.  This should display the app.
